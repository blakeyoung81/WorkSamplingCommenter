## Installation

1. **Download the Extension Files**
   - Download all files in this folder to a local directory on your computer

2. **Create Extension Icons** (Required)
   Since Chrome extensions require icon files, create three simple PNG icons:
   - `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
   - `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels) 
   - `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)
   
   You can use any simple icon - even a solid colored square will work for testing.

3. **Load Extension in Chrome**
   - Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top right)
   - Click "Load unpacked"
   - Select the folder containing all the extension files
   - The extension should appear in your extensions list

4. **Get OpenAI API Key**
   - Visit [OpenAI API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   - Create an account if you don't have one
   - Generate a new API key (starts with "sk-")
   - Copy the key - you'll need it to use the extension

## Usage

### First-Time Setup
1. **Install the Extension** (see Installation section above)
2. **Navigate to a Work Sampling Assessment Page**
   - Log into your Work Sampling System
   - Go to a student's checklist entry page
   - The page should have a comment textarea at the bottom
3. **Set up API Key**
   - Click the extension icon in your Chrome toolbar
   - Enter your OpenAI API key in the popup
   - Check "Remember API key" to save it for future use
   - Click "Generate Comment" (or close popup to use the on-page button)

### Daily Usage (After Setup)
1. **Navigate to any Work Sampling Assessment Page**
   - You'll see a green "ü§ñ Generate AI Comment" button in the top-right corner
   - If you haven't set up your API key yet, it will show "‚öôÔ∏è Setup AI Key" in orange

2. **Generate Comments Instantly**
   - Simply click the "ü§ñ Generate AI Comment" button
   - The button will show "‚è≥ Generating..." while working
   - The AI comment will automatically appear in the comment textarea

3. **Review and Submit**
   - Review the generated comment and make any necessary edits
   - Submit the form as usual

### Alternative Method
You can also use the extension popup:
- Click the extension icon in your Chrome toolbar
- Click "Generate Comment" in the popup
- This is useful if you want to change your API key settings

## How It Works

1. **Data Extraction**: The extension analyzes the assessment page to extract:
   - Student name, gender, birthday, and grade level
   - Assessment categories and ratings (NY, IP, PRO, NA, DNO)
   - Subject area being assessed

2. **AI Processing**: This data is sent to OpenAI's GPT-4 with a carefully crafted prompt that:
   - Establishes the AI as an exceptional preschool teacher
   - Emphasizes compassion, professionalism, and encouragement
   - Requests comments highlighting strengths while acknowledging growth areas
   - Ensures age-appropriate language for preschool contexts

3. **Comment Generation**: The AI generates a 150-300 word comment that:
   - Celebrates the child's achievements
   - Provides insight into their development
   - Uses warm, professional teacher language
   - Focuses on growth and encouragement

## Privacy & Security

- **API Key Storage**: Your OpenAI API key is stored locally in Chrome's storage - it never leaves your browser
- **Data Processing**: Assessment data is only sent to OpenAI's API and is not stored by this extension
- **No Third-Party Tracking**: The extension doesn't collect or transmit any personal data

## Cost Considerations

- This extension uses OpenAI's GPT-4 API, which charges per token
- Typical cost per comment generation: $0.01-0.03 USD
- You can monitor usage in your OpenAI dashboard

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Working
- Ensure all files are in the same folder
- Check that icon files exist (create simple PNG files if needed)
- Reload the extension in `chrome://extensions/`

### "Not a Work Sampling Page" Error
- Ensure you're on a student's checklist entry page
- The page should have both a comment textarea (#comments) and assessment table
- Try refreshing the page

### API Errors
- Check that your API key is valid and starts with "sk-"
- Ensure you have credits available in your OpenAI account
- Try generating the comment again

### Comment Not Inserted
- Check that the comment textarea exists on the page
- Try clicking in the textarea before generating
- Refresh the page and try again

## Support

This extension is designed specifically for the Work Sampling System interface. If you encounter issues:

1. Check the browser console for error messages (F12 ‚Üí Console tab)
2. Verify you're on the correct type of assessment page
3. Ensure your OpenAI API key is valid and has available credits
